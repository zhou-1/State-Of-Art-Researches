multi-speaker identification         
Acoustic Front-end Processing - Feature Extraction - Training process    
Learned the process and architecture of multi-speaker identification. Also there are different kinds of neural network.    

2. O'Neill, Erin   
Multi-speaker Identification State of the Art    
It's easy to see that a big advantage to speaker identification is the ability to have these systems that only respond to the owners voice.        
Using a simple machine learning process with a small training set a very promising result can be reached.  Additional work on this algorithm as well as larger training sets will allow for much better results that can be used in more important use cases.     

3. Li, Shuwei    
CNN based on digital signal processing       
CLDNN (convolutional, long short-term memory, fully connected deep neural networks) is a typical application of CNN. CNN and LSTM can obtain a better improvement than DNN, because CNN is good at reducing the change of frequency domain and LSTM can provide long term memory.       
CNN-based method brings a new direction into speech processing area. It can reduce WER sharply on some conditions. But also, it becomes deeper and more complicated, which indicates more computations.
