## What is docker    
Cloud is like a huge ship, dockers are building boxes on the ship.

"Build, ship and run"    
"Build once, run anywhere"    
Copy what I have done for current house as an image, put in a backpack; once go to a new place, paste this house design.      

3 core concepts:    
Image: provides needed program, repo, resources, configuration files as program needs, but also configuration parameters like environment variance. 
Container: the pasted house in the new place        
Repository: backpack          

Docker is an application that simplifies the process of managing application processes in containers. Containers let you run your applications in resource-isolated processes.    

Docker's start speed is quick, only need a few seconds; it can use resource very efficiently; also it only need little space (Virtual Machine needs GB, docker only needs MB or KB).
